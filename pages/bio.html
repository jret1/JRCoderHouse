                "Never shying away from straining the boundaries of his sound, blossoming Argentinian producer and DJ Joan Retamero continues to shine in recent times. His knack to create distinct and immersive atmospheres via various refined strains of house, and blurring this with techno textures, he has earned himself an array of releases on acclaimed labels, and gigs in hotspot cities around the world. The London based artist sets his grips firmly on his most prolific years ahead within the next period, looking to expand on his production output and continuing to share his story with dancefloors on a global scale, all whilst working tirelessly on his anticipated debut album which will see the light of day in the near future. 
                As Joan approaches near on a decade long career his colourful back catalogue continues to develop with outstanding releases including his debut single on Hernan Cattaneo’s famous SUDBEAT label, “Her Imagination And His Planet”. Fast forward a couple of years and a completion of a Music Production and Sound Engineering course at London’s Point Blank Music School Joan found himself playing in the legendary Ministry of Sound club on the same bill as pioneer of the game, Paul Oakenfold, this led to a slew of releases from Joan on Paul’s Perfecto Records, creating a strong relationship between the pair. Paul also released a prestigious compilation and involved Joan with a track called "She Dreamed Through The Sky", it was called "Sunset at Stonehenge" and he sits comfortably along the side of U2, Hans Zimmer, Vangelis, Pryda, and Empire Of the Sun. Receiving support from a host of his favourite artists also enabled Joan to have a collection of self released music which also became in high demand, whilst he currently sits on multiple albums and mini albums ready to share with labels and the world. 
                A notable highlight for Joan is his involvement with Burning Man, playing at the festival with a potential residency on the horizon, the first DJ from his city of Rosario to play at the esteemed festival. The transcending sound of Retamero has also seen him land gigs at amazing clubs such as EGG London, the aforementioned Ministry of Sound, and since then, he has had the opportunity to share the stage with the likes of Paul Oakenfold, Eric Prydz, Hernan Cattaneo, Guy J, Nick Warren, Patrice Baumel, Dave Seaman, Nic Fanciulli, Nora en Pure, Monolink, Gorgon City, Mathias Kaden, Idris Elba, Davide Squillace, Mariano Mellino, Kevin Di Serna, Khen, Budakid, Graziano Raffa, Soundexile, Kamilo Sanclemente, and Alex O' Rion. He has also been playing for more than 10000 people in Metropolitano Rosario, Pacha, E1, Culture Box and a country wide tour of his native country Argentina, finding himself at the nations hottest spots. Other acclaimed names he has joined are Gorgon City, Idris Elba, Davide Squillace, Mathias Kaden, and Nic Fanciulli. Amongst all of this he has taken his sound to Miami Music Week, Amsterdam Dance Event, and Sonar Barcelona along the way.  
                Versatility is a fine thing, and even sweeter when it comes in the form of Joan’s alternative productions, his unwavering passion for movies and soundtracks see him explore a more cinematic and experimental approach in recent times, developing this side of his musical personality is important to him, and aims to share these sounds in the years to come. 
                The illustrious journey Joan has already embarked on in a short space of time pays testament to his undeniable talent, thriving as a musician and reaping the rewards of his hard work. His pensive and melodic house sound continues to flourish, welcomed with open arms across the board and long may that continue."
